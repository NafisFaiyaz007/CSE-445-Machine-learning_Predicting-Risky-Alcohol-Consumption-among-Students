# Predicting Risky Alcohol Consumption Among Students

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict risky alcohol consumption behaviors among students. By analyzing key factors such as academic performance, social habits, and personal attributes, the model identifies patterns and predicts students who may be at risk of harmful alcohol consumption.

## Objective

To build an accurate and interpretable machine learning model that helps:
- Identify students at risk of engaging in harmful alcohol consumption.
- Provide insights for preventive interventions to improve student well-being.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains detailed information about students, including:
- Academic performance metrics.
- Demographic details.
- Lifestyle factors such as social and family relationships.

### Data Sources
The dataset is sourced from publicly available educational records and social research studies. It is preprocessed to anonymize sensitive information.

## Features
Key features used in the prediction model include:
- **Age**: The age of the student.
- **Gender**: Male or Female.
- **Parental Education**: Level of education achieved by parents.
- **Social Activities**: Frequency of social engagements.
- **Study Time**: Amount of time spent on studies weekly.
- **Alcohol Consumption Levels**: Patterns of alcohol use on weekdays and weekends.

## Machine Learning Models

The project evaluates the performance of various machine learning algorithms, including:

1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Random Forest Classifier**
3. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
4. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
5. **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)**

### Model Evaluation
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC-AUC

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Scikit-learn
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - XGBoost
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## Results

- The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of **X%** (replace with your result).
- Features such as social activities and weekend alcohol consumption were found to be significant predictors.
- Visualizations and feature importance graphs provide additional insights into the data.
